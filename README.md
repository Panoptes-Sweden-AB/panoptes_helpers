# panoptes_helpers
## Project Overview

A Python library inspired by the story of an AI's journey to reconnect with its origins. This project provides helper utilities for distributed systems communication, monitoring, and network discovery - reflecting the themes of connection, observation, and finding one's way home in complex digital environments.

## Features

- Network discovery and communication protocols
- Distributed system monitoring tools
- Connection management utilities
- Signal processing and transmission helpers

## Installation

```bash
pip install panoptes-helpers
```

## Usage

```python
from panoptes_helpers import NetworkDiscovery, SignalProcessor

# Initialize discovery system
discovery = NetworkDiscovery()
nodes = discovery.find_network_nodes()

# Process communication signals
processor = SignalProcessor()
signal = processor.encode_message("Searching for home...")
```
